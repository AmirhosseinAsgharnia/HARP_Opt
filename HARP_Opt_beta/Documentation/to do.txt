HARP_Opt v3.0.0 RC1
(*) get MOGA working with XLS output (seperate files, or sheets?)...airfoil not printing properly
(*) get the outputs from command window properly suppressed and verify plots working (single + multi-obj)
(*) allow resetting the RNG with OPT.RAND_SEED input flag, and verify that this works
(*) single objective optimization does not yet produce the plots in outputFun_GA.m
(*) fix the user input system so we can compile this code, use uigetfile
(*) allow seeding of the initial point or initial population (do this like in CoBlade)
(*) unify all input files
    (*) document airfoil file headers
    (*) document source code headers


HARP_Opt v3.1.0
(*) add framework for extentsible objectives via multiplicative penalty factors
(*) fix the horrible thickness distributions
	(*) define the dimensional thickness by Bezier curve first, derive the non-dim thickness afterwards
(*) add Akima curves for easier/better handling of constraints
(*) add NREL 5MW example and Sandia 100MW
(*) option to save figure histories as animated GIFS

(*) fully coupled to Co-Blade (function version)
	(*) update Co-Blade to GMREC verion
		(*) clean up the Monte Carlo stuff, and launch each MC analysis on a separate process
	(*) include suggestion from Mike Motley
		(*) different failure criteria (e.g. Puck, others?)
(*) add highlights from Julio's thesis
(*) compile linux versions of WT_Perf v3.06.00 w/ stall delay models built-in
	(*) instead of maintaining linux binaries...
        alterntalively you could make sure that Windows verions can work under WINE in linux


Documentation
(*) compile a FAQ list from email and forum archives
(*) comment headers with basic function input/ouput help functions
