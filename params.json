{"name":"Harp_Opt","tagline":"A rotor optimization tool for axial-flow wind and water turbines","body":"#Introduction\r\nHARP_Opt (**H**orizontal **A**xis **R**otor **P**erformance **Opt**imization) utilizes MATLAB's optimization algorithms and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL) [WT-Perf](http://wind.nrel.gov/designcodes/simulators/wtperf/) blade element momentum (BEM) code to design axial-flow wind and water (i.e. hydrokinetic) turbine rotors.\r\n\r\nThe code optimizes a rotor's performance for steady and uniform flows (no sheared or yawed flows). A variety of rotor control configurations can be designed using HARP_Opt, including fixed or variable rotor speed and fixed or variable blade pitch configuration. Blades with circular or non-circular roots are also supported.\r\n\r\nHARP_Opt can function as a single- or multiple-objective optimization code. The primary optimization objective is to maximize the turbine's annual energy production (AEP). Annual energy production is calculated using a Rayleigh, Weibull, or user-defined flow distribution. Maximum power is bounded, and maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is a combined objective with AEP. For hydrokinetic turbines, additional constraints are defined such that cavitation will not occur. An additional objective can be activated, in which HARP_Opt performs a structural optimization to minimize the blade mass. For the structural analysis, the blade is modeled as a thin shell of bulk isotropic material, and the blade mass is minimized using a maximum allowable strain as the constraint. Maximizing energy production and minimizing blade mass are conflicting objectives, thus HARP_Opt will identify the set of Pareto optimal solutions. To meet these objectives, HARP_Opt calculates the optimal blade shape (twist, chord, and airfoil/hydrofoil distributions) and optimal control of the rotor speed and blade pitch.\r\n\r\nThe HARP_Opt project was funded by the US Department of Energy [Water Power Program](http://www1.eere.energy.gov/water/). Code development and testing was performed at the NREL and the University of Tennessee.\r\n\r\n#Download\r\nCurrent Version:\r\n[v3.0.0 (Release Candidate 1)](https://github.com/NREL/HARP_Opt)\r\n\r\nPrevious Versions:\r\n[v2.0.0](http://wind.nrel.gov/designcodes/simulators/HARP_Opt/)\r\n\r\n#Installing and Running HARP_Opt\r\nSee the [HARP-Opt GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/NREL/HARP_Opt/wiki/).\r\n\r\n#Documentation\r\nDocumentation for v3.0.0 is currently under development\r\n\r\n#Current Code Maintainers\r\n* [Danny Sale](mailto:dsale@uw.edu) (University of Washington)\r\n* [Michael Lawson](mailto:Michael.Lawson@nrel.gov) (National Renewable Energy Laboratory)\r\n\r\n#Project Contributors\r\n* Danny Sale (University of Washington)\r\n* Michael Lawson (National Renewable Energy Laboratory)\r\n* Jason Jonkman (National Renewable Energy Laboratory)\r\n* David Maniaci (Sandia National Laboratories)\r\n* Marshall Buhl (National Renewable Energy Laboratory)\r\n","google":"UA-47137518-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
