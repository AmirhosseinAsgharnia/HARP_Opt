A general list of things to-do, and ideas that might be useful to the project:


HARP_Opt v3.0.0 (this is the first GitHub Tag)
(*) make sure GitHub account is setup properly for easier collaborative development
	(*) suggest according to Vincent Driessen's git branching model:
		http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/
(*) probably could need one more pass through the source code to combine functions 
	into a single file where appropriate
(*) make sure there are no more unintended debug messages printed to the console.  
	Maybe, suppress ALL output for parallel runs...otherwise overlapping text is 
	printed to the console from each process
	(*) OR...create an alternate output method for parallel runs?
(*) single objective optimization does not yet produce the plots in outputFun_custom.m
(*) unify built-in documentation inside the input files (some files may have slightly 
	different descriptions of the input parameters)
(*) add some error checking on the user inputs.  Matlab has ASSERT statements
	that would be best suited for this
(*) [bug] when compiled, the Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm gives some errors...
	it works fine in the non-compiled version though.  This error appears when
	changing 'SelectionFcn' to anything other than @selectionuniform ???

Documentation
(*) compile a FAQ list from email and forum archives...post to GitHub wiki/issues
(*) implement Doxygen for MATLAB to automatically create documentation and UML 
	type diagrams...Doxygen should be able to create huge amounts of documentation 
	automatically...but this relies on properly documented/formatted source code...
	(*) several Doxygen for MATLAB implmentations already exist...see File Exchange

HARP_Opt v3.1.0 and beyond...

(*) fix the horrible thickness distributions (prone to large curvature which is bad)
	this problem can be fixed by careful user inputs, but we need a more foolproof way:
	(*) define the dimensional thickness by Bezier/Akima curve first, derive the 
		non-dim thickness afterwards...this should fix the problem nicely and provide
		better structural designs
(*) add Akima curves for easier/better handling of constraints, and will allow users
	to import existing blade designs into HARP_Opt (as initial seeds)
(*) allow seeding of the initial point in the initial population (do this like 
	in CoBlade v1.30+)
(*) to make an simple GUI, use uigetfile() to select input file(s) or to write
	default example files
(*) add NREL 5MW example and Sandia 100MW (other more important reference models?)
(*) option to save figure as image files (or can save figure histories to later 
	create movies or GIFS)


(*) add framework for multiple objectives via multiplicative penalty factors 
	(like in Co-Blade)
(*) similar to CoBlade GMREC version, allow stochastic variation of aerodynamic design variables
(*) fully coupled to Co-Blade after move to GitHub (GMREC function version)	
(*) add highlights from Julio's thesis on HARP_Opt
	(*) generator coupling
	(*) constraints on angle of attack (stalling)
	(*) additional optimization algorithms (mostly of hueristic type)
	(*) others ...
(*) compile windows/linux versions of WT_Perf v3.06.00 w/ stall delay models built-in
	(*) instead of maintaining linux binaries...
        alterntalively you could make sure that Windows verions can work under WINE in linux?
(*) use CCBlade instead of WT_Perf (or does CCBlade already replace HARP_Opt entirely?)
